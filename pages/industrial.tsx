                    <h3>Pixley, CA</h3>
                    <p>The Calgren Dairy Fuels Biogas Plant collects manure-derived digester
                        gas
                        from
                        local dairies. The biogas is conveyed through an underground piping network to the plant
                        site
                        where
                        it is desulfurized, compressed and used as fuel for an onsite gas turbine and duct
                        burner.
                        Some
                        of
                        the gas is rendered pipeline quality by removing the CO2, further compressed and
                        injected in
                        the
                        local utility pipeline. Electrical design services included the development of a
                        self-regulating
                        heat trace system for several pipelines.
                        PID was responsible for the piping design, layout, stress analysis and development of
                        construction
                        drawings for the piping installation. The plant came on stream in mid-2018.</p>
